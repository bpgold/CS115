'''Explain what is the largest number of bits that your compress algorithm could 
possibly use to encode a 64-bit string/image'''
# Since COMPRESSED_BLOCK_SIZE =5, (64 *5)+ 5= 325 bits.  

'''Describe the tests that you conducted and the compression ratios that you found'''
# I tried different tests using the test function above to easily compare the functions.
# I found that the best compression ratios occurred when there were the most consecutive 1s or 0s.
# To  make sure I was correct I created the strings test3 and test4. As I thought, when there is an
#alternating 1s and 0s, the compression ratio will be much worse in comparsion to consecutive 1s and 0s.

'''"I have developed a new image compression algorithm Laicompress(S) that takes a 
64-bit string and always outputs a shorter string that represents that image. That is, every image 
is compressed at least somewhat by my algorithm. Argue to NASA that Professor Lai is Lai-ingâ€”such an algorithm cannot exist!
Try to make your reasoning as convincing and water-tight as possible. (In essence, you are 
proving that such an algorithm cannot exist.'''
# It is known that perfect compression algorithms are not always possible. For a compression algorithm
# to always output shorter string it would need to elimate information, so the compress method
#could not always produce shorter since complexity of the string is different in every problem
#This is just my idea, im not sure if it is 100% correct.
